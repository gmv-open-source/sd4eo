# CropTexSynthIntegration

This small repository contains a proof-of-concept piece of  code that takes a real set of Sentinel 1 & 2 images and replaces the existing crops with the content of a multiespectral synthetic texture of a selected type of crop in a target date (`plotReplacement.py`).

## Disclaimer

Much of the base code used in this project originates from third-party open source projects. GMV can only claim authorship of the modifications and the methodology developed for this solution, but not any other rights over the entire codebase, as numerous external authors have contributed to it in various ways.

## Code Quality

Please note that the current codebase is not yet cleaned or restructured. As this is part of an ongoing research effort, the code quality is not intended to be equivalent to production-level standards. The focus is on experimental validation, and as such, some parts may lack optimization or refactoring.
